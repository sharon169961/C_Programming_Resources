# **Student Grade Analysis**  

## **Problem Statement**  

A university wants to analyze student performance by processing their test scores. Write a program that:  

1. Computes the **average score** of students.  
2. Counts how many students scored **above the average**.  

## **Input Format**  

- The first line contains an integer `N`, representing the number of students.  
- The second line contains `N` space-separated integers, representing the test scores.  

## **Output Format**  

- Prints the **average score**, rounded to two decimal places.  
- Prints the count of students scoring **above the average**.  

## **Example Test Cases**  

### **Example 1**  

#### **Input:**  
```
5  
50 60 70 80 90  
```  
#### **Output:**  
```
Average Score: 70.00  
Students Above Average: 2  
```  

### **Example 2**  

#### **Input:**  
```
6  
30 45 50 55 60 75  
```  
#### **Output:**  
```
Average Score: 52.50  
Students Above Average: 2  
```  

## **Constraints**  

- `1 ≤ N ≤ 1000`  
- `0 ≤ Test Score ≤ 100`
